# About Me
I am a Research Officer in [DeCLaRe Lab](https://declare-lab.net/) at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD) under [Soujanya Poria](https://sporia.info/).

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) and an Undergraduate Research Assistant under [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/) at SUTD.

I did my undergraduate studies in computing at SUTD under the [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) (ISTD) pillar and graduated in 2020.

# Research Interests
I am interested in [embodied AI](https://embodied-ai.org/), knowledge graphs and multimodal machine learning.

I hope to explore grounded language learning and embodied AI tasks the involve language in the upcoming years.
