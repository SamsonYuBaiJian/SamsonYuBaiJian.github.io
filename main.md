I am a Master of Computing (AI Specialization) student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) and a researcher in the [Collaborative, Learning, and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) Lab](https://clear-nus.github.io/) working with [Prof. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/).

I am interested in structured representation learning and representational alignment for robot learning.

Previously, I held these positions:
- Researcher at the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), worked with [Dr. Cheston Tan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-cheston-tan) and [Dr. Zhu Hongyuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XTk3sYAAAAAJ&hl=en).
- Researcher in the [DeCLaRe Lab](https://declare-lab.net/) at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD), worked with [Prof. Soujanya Poria](https://sporia.info/).
- Computer science undergraduate student at [SUTD](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), graduated with Honours with Distinction.
