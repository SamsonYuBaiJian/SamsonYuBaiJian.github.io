# About Me
I am interested in AI/ML research for medicine and science.

I am an incoming PhD student (starting January 2025) at NUS Medicine with [Prof. Dianbo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&hl=en) from the [Cognitive AI for Science (CogAI4Sci) team](https://www.cogai4sci.com/).

Before this, I earned a Master of Computing (AI Specialization) from NUS and a Bachelor of Engineering (Information Systems Technology and Design) with Honors (Distinction) from SUTD.

I currently work with [Prof. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/) from the [Collaborative, Learning, and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) Lab](https://clear-nus.github.io/).
