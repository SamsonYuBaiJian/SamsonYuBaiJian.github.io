[CV](https://SamsonYuBaiJian.github.io/cv.pdf) / [Email](mailto:samson_yu@sutd.edu.sg) / [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pYb0xhAAAAAJ&hl=en) / [GitHub](https://github.com/SamsonYuBaiJian) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SamsonYuBaiJian) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsonyubaijian/)

I am a Research Officer in the [DeCLaRe Lab](https://declare-lab.net/) at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD), working with [Prof. Soujanya Poria](https://sporia.info/).

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), working with [Dr. Zhu Hongyuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XTk3sYAAAAAJ&hl=en), and an Undergraduate Research Assistant at SUTD, working with [Prof. Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/).

I did my undergraduate studies in [computer science](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at SUTD and graduated in 2020 with Honours with Distinction.

I am interested in [embodied AI](https://embodied-ai.org/), knowledge graphs and multimodal machine learning! I hope to explore grounded language learning and embodied AI tasks with language in the upcoming years.
